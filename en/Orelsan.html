    <h1 class="title">Oreslan: the earth is round</h1>
    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>This music was produced by Orlesan in 2011. Orlesan is a French rapper from Cean. Orelsan has composed several pieces of music in his career and is currently one of the best French rappers. Talking about her career, she started in 2006 and even today she is still active.</p>

    <h3>Why did I choose this music ?</h3>
    <p>At first I chose this music because he is a singer that I particularly appreciate, I listen to a lot of his songs. And, secondly, this music inspires me for these lyrics which consist in denouncing people who live too much in the past and who forget to savor the present time. </p>

    <h3>A direct view of life</h3>
    <p>In this song, Orelsan talks about his way of life, that is to say a slow life without pressure where the singer takes the time and the pleasure of living. This philosophy of life pleases me particularly well because I find that currently, we are in a society where everyone relies on the past and does not think enough about the present time. I find that this music denounces our society today.</p>

    <h3>A well-suited character </h3>
    <p>This representation of life is well represented in this music because Orelsan embodies the role of a 20/30 year old youngster and describes his life with a slow rhythm to show that you have to take the time to live.</p>

    <h3>A new life lesson for the future</h3>
    <p>According to Orelsan, we learn with the help of the song that we sometimes have to learn to let go and not always be afraid of what will happen to us tomorrow. Orelsan also denounces the weight of life in our society from the first chorus. Indeed, he denounces in particular the cost of living and the vicious circle that always pushes you to spend.</p>

    <h3>Why not an impact on the future</h3>
    <p>Finally, I hope that later I will become aware of this song and not live with the fear of the future and I would also like the world to evolve, especially the media with the news, the social networks that scare us and show us the future. May each people take the time to live without fear of the future.</p>
