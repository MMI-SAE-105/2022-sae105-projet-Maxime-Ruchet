         <h1 class="title">Steve Jobs: Biography</h1>
         <h3>Summary</h3>
         <p>This book was written at the request of Steve Jobs by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson" class="aexterne">Walter Isaacson</a> in 2011. It is a
            biography that tells the life of Steve Jobs from his childhood to his great success
            which is the creation of the famous apple brand as well as the different stages that have gone through it
            to carry out this beautiful project.</p>
         
         <h3>Why I chose this book</h3>
         <p>I chose it because it is a book that inspires me enormously given the motivation
            as well as the innovative side of Steve Jobs that it took to create his company. In addition
            what I particularly liked in this biography is that we learn everything about Steve's life since childhood. This book tells the story of his life in chronological order.
            according to its different periods. To be honest, it's one of the first books I've read in its entirety and had a lot of fun discovering. In my opinion, this is an achievement regarding the biography of Steve Jobs.</p>
         
         <h3>The negative points</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Not written directly by Steve Jobs</li>
            <li>Lack of confession by the author and his relatives</li>
            <li>Due to its 900 pages, felt a slight monotony in some passages of the book.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <h3>The positive points</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Very well written book</li>
            <li>Respects the various information concerning Steve Jobs</li>
            <li>Very immersive book</li>
            <li>Well-detailed history of Steve Jobs</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Inspiration for later</h3>
         <p>I hope later to be inspired by Steve Jobs. His side
            innovative as well as the determination that one feels in his book will help me in my life
            professional and personal. This book has me a lot more on the side
            technological than technical. Indeed, in the book we can see that
            between the 2000s and today, telephones have evolved enormously.
            Which is very interesting and promising.</p>

         <h3>Excerpt that stood out to me</h3>
         <p>“ Jobs has this incredible ability to invent gadgets that you don't need and suddenly can't live without. “ </p>
         <p>I chose this clip because for me it shows how innovative and very marketing Steve Jobs is. That's something I really like about him.</p>
